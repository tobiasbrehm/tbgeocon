                <strong>Liability for Content</strong>
                <p>The contents of our pages were created with great care. We cannot accept any responsibility for the correctness, completeness and topicality of the contents. As a service provider we are responsible for our own contents on these pages under the general laws according to &#167; 7 paragraph 1 of TMG. According to &#167; &#167; 8 to 10 TMG, we as a service provider are not obliged to monitor transmitted or stored foreign information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information under the general laws remain unaffected. However, liability is only possible from the date of knowledge of a specific infringement. Upon notification of such violations, we will remove the content immediately.</p>

                <strong>Liability for Links</strong>
                <p>Our pages contain links to external websites over which we have no control. Therefore, we cannot accept any responsibility for their content. The respective provider or operator of these linked pages is always responsible for their content. The linked sites were checked at the time of linking for possible violations of law. Illegal contents were not recognizable. A permanent control of the linked pages is unreasonable without concrete evidence of a violation. Upon notification of violations, we will remove such links immediately.</p>

                <p>The contents on these pages created by the site operator are subject to German copyright law. Duplication, processing, distribution and any kind of exploitation outside the limits of copyright require the written consent of the respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of these pages are only permitted for private, non-commercial use. As far as the content is not created by the website operator, the copyrights of third parties are respected. Contents of third parties are marked as such. If you still become aware of copyright infringement, we ask to be notified. Upon notification of violations, we will remove the content immediately.</p>

                <p>Our website may be used without entering personal information. Different rules may apply to certain services on our site, however, and are explained separately below. We collect personal information from you (e.g. name, address, email address, telephone number, etc.) in accordance with the provisions of German data protection statutes. Information is considered personal if it can be associated exclusively to a specific natural person. The legal framework for data protection may be found in the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) and the Telemedia Act (TMG). The provisions below serve to provide information as to the manner, extent and purpose for collecting, using and processing personal information by the provider.</p>
                <p>Please be aware that data transfer via the internet is subject to security risks and, therefore, complete protection against third-party access to transferred data cannot be ensured.</p>

                <h2>Cookies</h2>
                <p>Our website makes use of so-called cookies in order to recognize repeat use of our website by the same user/internet connection subscriber. Cookies are small text files that your internet browser downloads and stores on your computer. They are used to improve our website and services. In most cases these are so-called "session cookies" that are deleted once you leave our website.</p>
                <p>To an extent, however, these cookies also pass along information used to automatically recognize you. Recognition occurs through an IP address saved to the cookies. The information thereby obtained is used to improve our services and to expedite your access to the website.</p>
                <p>You can prevent cookies from being installed by adjusting the settings on your browser software accordingly. You should be aware, however, that by doing so you may not be able to make full use of all the functions of our website.</p>

                <h2>Server Data</h2>
                <p>For technical reasons, data such as the following, which your internet browser transmits to us or to our web space provider (so called server log files), is collected:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: '- ';">
                    <li>and version of the browser you use</li>

                    <li>websites that linked you to our site (referrer URL)</li>
                    <li>websites that you visit</li>
                    <li>date and time of your visit</li>
                    <li>your Internet Protocol (IP) address.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This anonymous data is stored separately from any personal information you may have provided, thereby making it impossible to connect it to any particular person. The data is used for statistical purposes in order to improve our website and services.</p>

                <h2>Disclosure / Suspension / Deletion</h2>
                <p>On the basis of the Federal Data Protection Act, you may contact us at no cost if you have questions relating to the collection, processing or use of your personal information, if you wish to request the correction, blocking or deletion of the same, or if you wish to cancel explicitly granted consent. Please note that you have the right to have incorrect data corrected or to have personal data deleted, where such claim is not barred by any legal obligation to retain this data.</p>
